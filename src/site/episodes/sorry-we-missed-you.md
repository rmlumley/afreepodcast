title: Sorry We Missed You
subtitle: "The Work Sucks Summer continues with a marathon episode about Ken Loach's Sorry We Missed You. The movie is sad enough, so we figured we might as well just get everything off our chests this week. The Gig Economy, 'Independent Contractors,' and recognizing truly dangerous jobs are a sampling of the topics we touch on. It's still funny sometimes, we promise."
