title: Flash Gordon
subtitle: We have another special patreon request. We talk about the Gen X classic Flash Gordon. We discuss Max von Sydow, William Hootkins and Sam J Jones. We also discuss the Queen soundtrack and wonder who would be the best artist to score a Flash Gordon remake. Finally, we announce the theme of our next season.
