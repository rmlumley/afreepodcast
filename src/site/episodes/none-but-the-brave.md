title: None but the Brave
subtitle: We continue with HOF musicians and talk about Frank Sinatra and his anti-war film, None but the Brave. We get to just touch on a little bit of the insanity of Frank Sinatra's life by keeping it to the mid-1960s. Finally, we share our favorite Sinatra Christmas songs.
