title: "Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans"
subtitle: Nic Cage is having a moment. We take a look at his collaboration with Werner Herzog and share some of our favorite stories about both men. Is Port of Call a very clever ACAB film or a lazy dumb remake? Finally, we discuss other post-Katrina depictions of America.
