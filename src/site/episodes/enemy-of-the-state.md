title: Enemy of the State
subtitle: "The NSA is Goin' Online in the 1998 conspiracy thriller Enemy of the State. In addition to breaking down the film and its monster cast, we dive in our favorite Gene Hackman performances, the surveillance state, and throw in some bonus talk about lingerie stores to keep the Deep State off our tails."
