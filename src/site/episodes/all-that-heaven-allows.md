title: All that Heaven Allows
subtitle: "We move into week two of our midlife crisis and examine the great 1950s Douglas Sirk melodrama All That Heaven Allows. Are there second acts in love and life? Not if your gossipy neighbors and selfish kids have anything to say about it. We'll talk about starting over with someone new in middle age, Douglas Sirk, Rock Hudson, and being the child of someone having a midlife crisis."
