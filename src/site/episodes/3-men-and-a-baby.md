title: Three Men and a Baby
subtitle: We start our "How to Be a Dad" series early with a discussion of a deeply strange movie, Clifford. Ever want to see a 10 year old played by a 40 year old - then this is the perfect movie for you. We also talk about some of our favorite comedies that no one else likes.
