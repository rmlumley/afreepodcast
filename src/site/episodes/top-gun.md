title: "Top Gun"
subtitle: "Top Gun: Maverick comes out later this week and we are here to capitalize on it! We talk Tom Cruise, the soundtrack and the hunks of Top Gun. Is this movie coherent? Is Kelly McGillis the most famous astrophysicist in cinema? What shirtless activity would we want to be filmed doing?"
