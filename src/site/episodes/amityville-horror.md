title: The Amityville Horror
subtitle: We look back at the original 1979 The Amityville Horror. While we weren't impressed by this haunted house movie - it did give us the opportunity to talk about the various grifters that helped make this possible. Finally, we have a spirited discussion about buying a murder house.
