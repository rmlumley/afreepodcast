title: "Mask"
subtitle: "Nope, not the Jim Carrey movie. We are talking about Mask, the Peter Bogdanovich film from 1985. We discuss Bogdanovich's career, Cher and the real life story about Rocky Dennis. We also share our takes on the Springsteen/Seger change that resulted in a law suit against Universal. Before all that though - Duff's trip to Disney."
